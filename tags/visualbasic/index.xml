      <description>Here is a free Excel Add-In to clean dirty text the easy way!
Back Story I have had to make several text cleaning functionalities for the front-end of Excel lately due banking entries, randomized strings, you name it.
I thought, why not just build an Add-In I can install in any workbook that needs it? Also, I figured you guys could use it since there doesnâ€™t seem to be any Excel function like this.</description>

      <title>Word Study Sankey Chart</title>

      <description>Overview I am currently taking a break from the high computing power of R libraries and learning how these these tools can practically work in other applications.
One such chart is the Sankey Chart. I decided to make one using Visual Basic for my bible word study.
Sankey charts really help do bible word studies (i.e. text mining) since it helps see what counting word usage (translations) alone cannot.
Example Word Study For example, each biblical use of the word &amp;ldquo;jealous&amp;rdquo; is important in its own way.</description>
